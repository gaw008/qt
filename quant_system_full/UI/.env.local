# === React Frontend Security Configuration ===
# CRITICAL: Do not expose API tokens in frontend bundles
# This file should only contain environment-specific URLs

# Remove API token from frontend - authentication handled by backend
# VITE_API_TOKEN removed for security - use backend authentication

# API Base URL (use proxy in development for security)
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Security: All authentication tokens must be handled server-side only
# Frontend authentication will be managed through secure HTTP-only cookies
